I had the privilege of attending <a href="http://www.sempdx.org/searchfest/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SearchFest</a> in Portland today, presented by <a href="http://www.sempdx.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SEMpdx</a>, a local organization that provides support to local area Search Engine Marketing businesses. From what I've seen, the organization is well established and growing every year. This years SearchFest demonstrated that growth, which required a larger venue at the <a href="http://www.governorhotel.com/" target="_blank">Governor Hotel</a>. Some of the sponsors of SearchFest were <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">OregonLive.com</a>, <a href="http://www.aboutus.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">AboutUs</a>, <a href="http://www.anvilmediainc.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Anvil Media</a> and <a href="http://www.webvisionsevent.com/portland/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">WebVisions</a>.

The morning started off with the very energetic <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/LosBuenos" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eli Goodman</a> of <a href="http://www.comscore.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">comScore</a>. Eli talked about the current search landscape and shook a magic 8 ball to share his predictions on what search engine marketing means in 2012. One of the more interesting points in his talk pointed out overall search has increased 11% since 2010. And that searchers on Bing are searching 30% more than searchers on Google. Oh, and you'll love this: October 18, 2011 was when your Google Analytics data stopped reporting search terms based on users privacy settings. Have you ever seen (not provided) in your analytics data? Thanks, Eli, for explaining this.

After the morning keynote, I headed down stairs to attend the "Marketing Challenges and the Tools to Solve Them" presentation with <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/randfish" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Rand Fishkin</a> of <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SEOmoz</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/justinrbriggs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Justin Briggs</a> of <a href="http://www.bigfishgames.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Big Fish Games</a>. Apparently there was a past challenge between the two and this was a rematch of sorts. The talk consisted of the two suggesting products to help achieve daily goals, technical challenges, social management, etc. Rand took the prize by a small margin. Justin provided some good technical and datamining tools which may have lost the non-techy crowd. Both gave excellent presentations.

"Advanced Social Media Tactics" was my next stop. This presentation was given by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/w2scott" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Will Scott</a> (His name is WILL SCOTT) of <a href="http://www.searchinfluence.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Search Influence</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/aimclear" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Marty Weintraub</a> of <a href="http://www.aimclearblog.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">aimClear</a>. The most memorable part of this presentation involved women over 50 and personal lubricant. I won't go any further. Marty didn't need the microphone in the Heritage Ballroom. In fact, I think people in Beaverton heard his presentation loud and aimClear (sorry for the pun!).

What is "Advanced Off-Site SEO"? According to <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/shendison" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Scott Hendison</a> of <a href="http://www.seoautomatic.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Search Commander</a>, it involves 11 slides we never saw. And according to <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/portentint" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Ian Lurie</a> of <a href="http://www.portent.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Portent</a> it involves doing the basics but doing them well. I feel that this session could have been better executed even though I did find value in what was said. The conversation of "Black Hat" vs. "White Hat" still exists.

I attended the "Local/Mobile Strategies &amp; Tactics" session with <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/si1very" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Chris Silver Smith</a> of Argent Media and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/gsterling" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Greg Sterling</a> of <a href="http://www.screenwerk.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Sterling Market Intelligence</a>. Chris focused a lot of time on Google Places and tactics to insert micro-data on to your site to inform search engines about what type of data you have. Greg simply said, about mobile, "if you don't have mobile, you're dead". I didn't really take anything out of this topic about mobile other than statistics show that most local searches are on mobile devices. I would think B2C would be the appropriate candidate for a mobile site while B2B would be less likely.

The closing Keynote speaker was <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/wilreynolds" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Wil Reynolds</a> of <a href="http://www.seerinteractive.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SEER Interactive</a>. Wil can really hold an audience. His presentation focused on the idea that the search engine marketing industry can't clearly define the right way or the wrong way to approach search engines. Web Master guidelines provided by Google clearly state what is/isn't accepted. But, sites that are taking the right approach (according to Google) are ranking lower on SERPs than sites taking the wrong approach (according to Google). WTF?! The moral of Wil's story was that you do what you need to do to get the job done while also building strong connections using social media. By the way, Wil's head size is 7-5/8. <a href="http://www.lids.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Lids.com</a>, give that head measuring tool a proper link.

While there were many sessions I didn't see, these were the most important and relevant to my job. I'm sure the Paid &amp; Analytics track was very exciting and informative, unfortunately I wasn't able to attend them. I believe that any marketing strategy needs quality content and social connections regardless of paid advertising. SearchFest is a great conference. I met a lot of people from within Portland and from as far away as Arkansas. I look forward to attending again in the future. Maybe next year we can talk about MySpace marketing (smirk).

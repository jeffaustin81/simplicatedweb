I've just recently been turned on to <a href="https://www.inboxq.com/" target="_blank">InboxQ</a>, a social media tool that searches for questions on <a href="https://twitter.com/" target="_blank">Twitter</a> based on topics of your choice. I haven't put it through it's paces yet, but what I've seen has been pretty interesting and useful.

The idea of searching questions has been around for a long time. Think <a href="http://www.quora.com/" target="_blank">Quora</a>, <a href="http://www.ask.com" target="_blank">Ask.com</a> or <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">Stack Overflow</a>. These sites are good for long answers and historical documenting. I get that. A user can post a question and a day later (hopefully), someone will answer their question.

But, what if you're at a store and you need an immediate answer but don't have time to search for the answer because the store closes in half an hour and you just have to find out if that widget you spotted is going to work with your thingy-ma-jig? You're going to whip out your iPhone and ask your social network, right? Thought so.

InboxQ will connect those knowledgeable of widgets and thingy-ma-jigs to your questions. Random strangers will jump at the chance to help you out. If there's one thing I know about the internet, it's that everyone wants to be the first to answer a question. Inboxq facilitates that desire.

I recently <a href="http://factoryjoe.com/blog/2010/06/13/social-media-versus-oil-can-henrys/" target="_blank">read an article</a> (it's dated) on <a href="http://factoryjoe.com" target="_blank">factoryjoe.com</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/chrismessina" target="_blank">Chris Messina</a> about an experience he had while at <a href="http://www.oilcanhenrys.com" target="_blank">Oil Can Henry's</a>, a fun and friendly oil change company. Chris used <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2009/07/07/you-put-your-aardvark-in-my-twitter-bonus-interview-with-founders/" target="_blank">Aardvark</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/vark" target="_blank">@vark</a>), a service that is no longer available. The purpose of Aardvark was to find Twitter users who specialized in topics of the question you asked. It would @ (at) the specialists with your question and hopefully they would reply with knowledgeable nuggets at 140 characters.

Chris received valuable information from the answers he received. In his case, it wasn't soon enough. But that's not my point. My point is that now, with InboxQ, we are able to simply ask a question on Twitter, and moments later have an answer. You might just skip buying that widget at 9:30pm if someone who knows about such things promptly responds to your question.

To get started using InboxQ, download one of the plugins: <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/amcfkcmgenemckhnbodhgmakhodjhkae" target="_blank">Chrome</a>, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/inboxq/" target="_blank">Firefox</a>, <a href="https://marketplace.seesmic.com/plugins/inboxq" target="_blank">Seesmic</a>, <a href="http://hootsuite.com/appdirectory" target="_blank">Hootsuite</a>. This is not the end of social Q &amp; A services, it's only the beginning.

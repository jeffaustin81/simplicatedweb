Over the years I've had the fortune of trying various WordPress plugins. Some plugins didn't pass my high standards, while others shine like rainbows on a brisk spring morning. I'll let you dance in the meadow for a moment before I continue... Ok, let's do this. Here is my list of the top 5 essential WordPress plugins you should be using on your blog or website.
<ol>
	<li><a href="http://yoast.com/wordpress/seo/" target="_blank">WordPress SEO Plugin by Yoast</a>
This plugin gives you the tools to be the rockstar of on-site SEO. You can globally manage all of your pages'/posts' titles, meta descriptions, meta robots and so much more. WordPress SEO Plugin also generates XML sitemaps for pages, posts and tags.</li>
	<li><a href="http://disqus.com" target="_blank">Disqus Comment System</a>
The Disqus Comment system is by far the easiest comment system I've ever used. The best part about it is that a commenter can have a global login. If I leave a comment on one blog with Disqus and later visit another blog and leave a comment, I will already be logged in to the Disqus system. Another cool feature is that when I'm on that other blog, I will be able to see notifications of blogs I previously commented on if there are new comments. An obvious benefit of Disqus is it's slick design that can be easily dropped in to almost any website.</li>
	<li><a href="http://devgrow.com/sharebar-wordpress-plugin/" target="_blank">Sharebar</a>
Sharebar isn't without it's flaws. But, it is very versatile by allowing blog administrators to add custom elements like the Google +1 button. You can choose to have this sharebar displayed on both posts and pages. My favorite feature is that it stays on screen as the user scrolls the page making it easy for them to "Like" it on Facebook or Tweet about it.</li>
	<li><a href="http://blog.ashfame.com/2011/02/wordpress-plugin-fix-facebook-like-thumbnail/" target="_blank">Facebook Like Thumbnail</a>
Facebook wants to use the first image it detects on your page as the thumbnail by default. This plugin gives you the choice of having a default image or using the first image of your post content as the Facebook thumbnail image. It comes in handy when your logo is display via CSS or your first image is an advertisement.</li>
	<li><a href="http://bluesome.net/post/2005/08/18/50/" target="_blank">Exec-PHP</a>
One of the hardest things to overcome when working with a client is telling them they can't do something because of the limitations of the CMS you told them was the best solution. With Exec-PHP you don't have to. If you want to pull custom post-types in the sidebar, now you can. There are many other uses of Exec-PHP since it allows you to run raw PHP code right in a text widget or post content.</li>
</ol>
In addition to these plugins, I am also a fan of <a href="http://www.contactme.com/" target="_blank">Contact Me's Contact Form plugin</a> and <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/mailchimp/" target="_blank">MailChimp's plugin</a>. What plugins do you recommend? Share them in the comments below.

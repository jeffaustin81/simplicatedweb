It makes sense. Her website was developed using WordPress, so the means to start a blog are pretty much set in place. So, I asked her if she <em>wants</em> to blog. You see, you actually need to have a desire to blog to be successful at it. My client answered the question honestly and said "No. But I will if I have to."

If you don't enjoy it, if you don't see the value in it, don't do it. Lorelle VanFossen of <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Lorrelle on WordPress</a> says in her book, <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/books/blogging-tips/" target="_blank">Blogging Tips</a>:
<blockquote>Anyone can blog about anything they want, but a blogger with direction and purpose is a magnet for energy and enthusiasm. In it's basic form, blogging is about self-publishing. It's about self-expression.</blockquote>
So ask yourself why you want to blog. Is it because you have an opinion and you want to share it with the world? Is it to help others similar to you? Is it for business or pleasure?

Once you've identified why you want to start blogging, you need to commit yourself to it and define your own <a href="http://www.johnchow.com/how-to-set-and-achieve-your-blogging-goals-in-2012/" target="_blank">blogging goals</a>. And remember that your blog is as much for you as it is your readers. Make reading your blog an enjoyable experience.

Good content is good for the user and good for your business. Erin Kissane, author of <a href="http://www.abookapart.com/products/the-elements-of-content-strategy" target="_blank">The Elements of Content Strategy</a>, says about good content:
<blockquote>There’s really only one central principle of good content: it should be appropriate for your business, for your users, and for its context.</blockquote>
<h3>Should YOU blog?</h3>
You are the only one that can answer that question. Be honest with yourself. Don't set too high of bar. And above all else, have fun.

The web and social sites like Facebook and Twitter make bashing your brand too easy.

So, what do you do when you are the victim of a negative comment or review? There's a right way and a wrong way. I hope that after reading these tips you'll choose the right way to handle negative reviews. If you're a small business owner, bad reviews can be detrimental to your success.

Before we get knee deep in online brand management, know that your customers are more likely to leave a bad review than any review at all. And just because you might have received a bad review doesn't mean that everyone views your business negatively. Following these tips will earn you more fans and may even convert that negative reviewer into a brand advocate.
<h3>3 Tips to Handle Negative Comments in Social Media</h3>
1. Act fast. Ignoring or avoiding the review will only make matters worse. You don't want to others to see that you haven't responded. Not responding to a complaint sends a message that you don't care about your customers concerns. Responding quickly establishes trust with your community.

2. Be transparent. Keeping your communications in public tell your fans that you have nothing to hide. Use your best judgement on when to take the matter offline. You don't want to risk the individual getting more frustrated and lashing out. Offer to chat over email or on the phone. Don't send them to an impersonal feedback form that requires them to repeat what you already know.

3. Ask them how you can make it right. Sometimes customers just want to vent. Now that they have your attention their attitude might change. Asking them how you can make their situation better may catch them off guard. Be sure to follow through with whatever you promise.

Negative comments aren't going to put you out of business. They may, however, cause a new customer to think twice about supporting your business. Be sure you ask your customers to leave positive reviews on Google+ Local, Yelp and other social media sites. It's always best to have positive reviews that out-number negative ones.

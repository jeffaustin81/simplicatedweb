The Internet is a wide open field of information, and whether you like it or not, information about your company can be found online. Social media, blogs and online review sites have given customers the power to share their true feelings about your brand.

Monitoring your brand’s online presence is extremely important, and with tools like <a href="http://www.google.com/alerts">Google Alerts</a>, <a href="http://www.radian6.com/">Radian6</a> and Review Trackers, monitoring what’s being said about your brand online is easier than ever. If you’re still not sure why you need to know what’s being said about your company, here are five reasons.

<strong>You can gain consumer insight.</strong>

When you monitor your brand online, you can find out exactly what your consumers are saying about your brand. You can learn what they love about your company, products and services, and you can learn what they hate. This allows you to make the necessary changes that are needed to keep your customers happy and give them what they want.

<strong>You can learn more about your consumers.</strong>

Monitoring your brand online also allows you to learn where people are discussing your brand, product or services. Are people turning to social media sites? If so, you may want to ensure that your company can be found on these networks so that you can reach out directly to your consumers, get to know them and build a relationship with them.

<strong>You can learn what your competition is saying.</strong>

It’s possible that your competition is talking about you, and monitoring your brand can help you find out what they’re saying. This will allow you to create your own marketing strategy that combats their efforts. For example, if they accuse you of making cheap products, you can create a marketing campaign that centers around your commitment for choosing high-quality materials and your brilliant engineering process. This allows you to stay one step ahead of your competition at all times.

<strong>You can combat false information.</strong>

Monitoring your brand online allows you to locate false information about your company and have it corrected. For example, if you notice that a customer left a comment on a review site about your business, and the review site has your company address and hours of operation wrong, you can claim your own business page and correct these errors. If you notice that a partner company is using your outdated logo, you can contact them and provide them with your current logo so that your branding is consistent throughout the Internet.

<strong>You can alleviate PR nightmares.</strong>

Customers are using the power of the Internet to leave comments and feedback on your company, both positive and negative. By monitoring your brand, you will be alerted to any negative reviews that appear or negative comments that are left on social media sites or blogs. This way, you can step in right away and try to alleviate the situation before it spreads into a major PR nightmare.

Don’t be fooled into thinking that you don’t need to pay attention to what’s being said about your brand online. When you take the right steps to monitor your company’s reputation, you’ll be able to learn valuable information and keep your company out of harm’s way.

Or, design provides more function than style. It informs but doesn't dictate. The more pretty layers you slap on something, the more complicated it becomes.

In marketing, we have a narrow focus on disruption. Whether it's a TV or Radio commercial, Billboard or Web Banner advertisement - we want to catch the attention of the person sitting on the couch, listening to their headphones, driving down the road, etc. and we only have 15 to 30 seconds to do it.

Websites, on the other hand, should inform the user but not dictate to the user. But now I'm dictating. You'll see where this is going soon enough.

When designing a website, evaluate your customers needs and their intent without making broad assumptions. Consider the capabilities of their device and context (place, time, position) of their environment in which they are consuming your content.

Considering <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/what%E2%80%99s-a-buying-cycle-and-why-should-i-care/" target="_blank">the importance of the buying cycle</a>, don't expect to make a sale on the first interaction. Your website is not a convenience store.

Present your product or service in a way that informs your visitors. Do not trap your sales pitch behind a lead generation form. This will send the wrong message to the visitor causing them to leave and never return.

Be certain that your website functions properly on all devices and browsers. Even older versions of Internet Explorer. Yes, people are still using Windows XP with Internet Explorer 6. Notice the words I used -- "website functions properly."

A website will not and cannot look the same in all browsers. If you can read, navigate and submit web forms with JavaScript disabled, you're website will work on every device.

If your website uses media queries for responsive web design, expect IE 8 and below to use your mobile-first design unless you take extra care and craft a IE-only stylesheet.

Your customers don't care about your website's design (unless it's out of date, mis-guided, amateurish, or uses a non-font like Comic Sans). They want to learn more about what you're selling. Simplify your site and shine a light on the goods and you can't go wrong.

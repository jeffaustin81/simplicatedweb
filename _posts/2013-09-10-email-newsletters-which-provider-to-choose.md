One of the most important aspects of your online business is your email newsletter. If you don't currently have an email newsletter, here is a list of providers I recommend.

Some are simple and easy to use for quick emails. Others are more complex but allow you to have a custom design.

Which ever one you choose, you'll always be able to export your list and try another. But don't make it a habit as it can have a negative effect with spam software.

#### [MailChimp](http://mailchimp.com/)
MailChimp is, by far, the most comprehensive and user-friendly newsletter provider I've ever used. They are constantly improving the interface and looking to the future with responsive email layouts that fit within any device. You're able to segment your lists by various criteria, generate reports, view your top subscribers and so much more. There is even a WordPress plugin which makes getting new subscribers very easy.

#### [Constant Contact](http://www.constantcontact.com/)
A mainstay in the email marketing world, Constant Contact is a very reputable newsletter provider and is very active in communities around the country. Their reporting system isn't as intuitive as MailChimps and creating list segments requires downloading your list and re-uploading it to a new list.

#### [TinyLetter](http://tinyletter.com/)
As their slogan goes, Email for people with something to say. TinyLetter is a product of MailChimp. The best part of TinyLetter is its lack of options. You have a list, you send it a newsletter. There are no templates to choose from. It works on mobile devices without any extra effort.

#### Other Services
I know there are plenty of other services available ([AWeber](http://www.aweber.com/), [Emma](http://myemma.com/), [YMLP](http://www.ymlp.com/), [Mad Mimi](https://www.madmimi.com/)), but I do not have experience with them. Email on Acid is one service I've used soley for their [email previews](http://www.emailonacid.com/email-preview), a nice way to test your HTML email template in 30 different email clients with one click.

#### Things to Consider
* Never add an email address to your newsletter list unless you have that persons consent. [It's against the law](http://www.business.ftc.gov/documents/bus61-can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business)!
* Keep your subject lines short and concise. ([Subject line tips](http://kb.mailchimp.com/article/best-practices-in-writing-email-subject-lines))
* Write your newsletter copy as if you were writing to a friend.
* Share unique content. Something only subscribers can get.

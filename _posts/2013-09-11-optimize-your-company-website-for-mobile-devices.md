Your website has the incredible ability of being always on and everywhere.

Even though it's great to be everywhere at any given time in any given situation, it's important to note that not every user should have the same experience.

There are many things to consider with the various devices that could connect to your website at any given moment.

* **Bandwidth:** Are they connected with Highspeed Internet?
* **Screen Size:** Will your content fit on their screen?
* **Time of Day:** What contact info is shown when your business is closed?
* **Location:** Do you provide offers to visitors within walking distance?

And the list goes on.

#### Who Is Your Website For?
First, you must know who your audience is and how they will access your website. If 99% of the people coming to your site are Windows PC users during normal business hours at their office, then you have little to worry about. If, however, they range from casual web surfers, mobile phone or tablet users, business professionals, etc., you'll want a website that loads quickly and fits the device they're using.

#### Should My Website Be Optimized For Mobile Devices?
Once you've established your audience, should you A) Create a website that is scalable for mobile and large-screen devices, or B) Create a fixed-width website that mobile users will need to pinch and zoom to see your content?

**Pinch and Zoom**, while it may seem harmless, will frustrate people and they won't continue reading or buy what you're selling. Avoid forcing pinch and zoom whenever possible.

#### Websites For Any Device
Instead, you want a responsive website. Erase any preconceived ideas of how your website will look on an iPhone, iPad, Nexus 7, Samsung Galaxy, and so on. On small screens, it's important to keep the content as clear and uncluttered as possible.

Websites built around responsive design reshape and resize to fit the screen. Content can be hidden or revealed based on the width of the device.

Mobile is huge. Devices are more affordable now than they ever have been making the internet accessible to anyone with thumbs (yes, [monkeys too [video]](http://mashable.com/2011/07/21/monkey-iphone/)). If your website isn't optimized for mobile devices, you're losing customers.

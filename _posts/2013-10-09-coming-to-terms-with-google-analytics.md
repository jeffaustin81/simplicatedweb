If you're not already tracking visitors on your site with an analytics software, you should be. But there are a some things you should know.

#### What is Google Analytics Good At?

Great question. Google Analytics is a great resource for reviewing targeted data points like bounce rate, duration of visit, content interest, landing pages, traffic source and a dozen other metrics.

#### What is Google Analytics Bad At?

Over the years, Google has refined it's products and services. The biggest service being the search engine. As of late, more and more of site visitors are flocking to the new Google+ social network. As a result of new users signing up for an account on this social network, their keyword data is now shrouded behind the **(not provided)** label.

#### What Can You Do About (not provided)?

**Google Webmaster Tools**

You should already have a Google Webmaster Tools account. If you don't, be sure to get one ASAP. These simple set of tools allow you to upload a sitemap of your site, troubleshoot issues, and set up alerts for when your site goes down or is infected with malware. In addition, you can also see what keywords your website had impressions for and the kind of traffic you received.

**Google AdWords**

You bet Google will give you the keywords if you buy ads targeting them. You won't see the referral traffic in Google Analytics, but at least you can see how your ads are performing for the keywords you choose.

**Fitler (not provided) Data**

The easiest method for novices to filter (not provided) data is to create an Advanced Segment on organic traffic and see the landing pages. You can do this by navigating to `Acquisition > Keywords > Organic` and click "Advanced Segments" at the top of the screen.

Once you've set this up, click "Save Segment" and you'll be looking at all of your organic traffic that's behind Google's Iron Curtain.

The next step is to click on "Landing Page" next to "Primary Dimension" above the results table to see which pages are receiving the traffic.

#### Don't Think It's Over

Google is known for making changes without being forthcoming with information. For the past two years we've been battling two algorithm changes, Panda & Penguin, and more recently we are faced with a new algorithm change, Hummingbird, which is [Google's biggest change in 3 years](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/27/google-biggest-algorithm-change-hummingbird). Keep your head up and your eyes and ears open. Things are changin'!

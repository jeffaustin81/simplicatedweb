![Pros and Cons of Rotating Heroes](/images/blog-pros-cons-rotating-heroes.png)

Regardless of how much traffic your website receives, about 2/3 of your visitors will never see your home page.

This is largely due to non-branded search terms and social media referrals.

If only 1/3 of your website visitors see your home page, should website owners invest in rotating heroes? Let's look at the pros and cons of rotating heroes (Carousels/Sliders):

#### Rotating Hero Pros

* Allow multiple "Features" in a small space
* Promote new products or services
* Can be changed quickly

#### Rotating Hero Cons

* Unecessary weight (bytes) to the page causing longer than expected load times
* Users rarely stay on your home page longer than 10 seconds
* Used to supplement poor navigation
* Generally ignored by users ([source](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/auto-forwarding/))
* Challenging to implement on mobile devices

To determine if rotating heroes are right for your website, set up an [Experiment](http://youtu.be/TGrujIh2H0I) in Google Analytics to compare a home page with rotating heroes to a home page with a static hero and track user interactions.

Even though rotating heroes sound like a good idea, they may not be as effective as you'd hope.

I recommend [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) to clients because its feature-set is continuously being improved and security patches are released frequently.

For an Open-Source solution, WordPress is by far the best in its class.

#### One Click Upgrade, Not So Fast!

Many of you may already be aware of the latest version of WordPress since it's announced in plain view within the Dashboard. I know it's tempting to just click the link and be on your way.

In addition to new versions of the WordPress core files, you may also see newer versions of themes and plugins.

There are some things you should be aware of before beginning any upgrade process.

* **WordPress Core** - You've logged in to the Dashboard and a message at the top of your screen says "WordPress x.x is available! Please update now." How much do you know about this new version? What issues does it resolve? Read the release notes in the [WordPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/) (see "Current WordPress Version"). If it's a security release, you should definately upgrade (see below).
* **Themes** - The only themes you should have installed are themes you are using. Un-used themes are known security holes. If your WordPress installation uses parent/child themes, be cautious of what you're upgrading. Custom JavaScript files may be overwritten if you upgrade a parent theme causing some site functionality issues. Theme upgrades may also change the way your site looks which may not be desired. Use caution before upgrading any theme (see below).
* **Plugins** - Ahhhh, plugins. Some WordPress sites rely heavily on plugins from authors around the globe. Be careful, plugin authors can completely re-write their plugin and in turn a new release may break your site. Pay very close attention to the release notes before upgrading any plugins (see below).

Are you frightened yet? Well, you should be. WordPress is one of the easiest [Content Management Systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system) to use, and probably has the easiest upgrade system. But with *easy* comes *scary*.

You **MUST** always backup your website's files and database prior to any upgrade. Doing this will save you a lot of headache when something goes wrong.

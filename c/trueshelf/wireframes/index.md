The purpose of a wireframe is to determine what needs to be included and what is unecessary to the goals of the website.

TrueShelf is unlike other community sites. Visitors are encouraged to write a question even though the answer system is disabled (multiple-choice excluded).

Because the user-base are instructed to visit the website to research specific theories and problem sets, search should be the key focus for all users.

These wireframes will help guide the design phase but not dictate it.

#### Search / Levels / Topics / Tags

One major flaw with the default design is the separation of tags from the search box. The site suggests a user can add multiple tags to a search, yet the only way of doing so is by using the tags that are displayed in the search results. The design below places all three filter options in the right sidebar.

If it's possible, I recommend removing "Levels" and "Topics" from the site all together and utilize "Tags" as they are easier to use. I do, however, realize visitors may specify they want High School questions and would rather not see "Undergraduate" questions. Tags alone won't facilitate that so it's best to keep things as they are.

These will be color coded to visually aid the user when navigating.

#### Post Something

Too many options causes confusion. The four buttons "Exercise", "Video", "Notes", "Multiple-Choice", all require the user to know what each is for prior to submitting. The "Post Something" button allows the user time to become aquainted with the post system. Clicking "Post Something" results in a pop-up module that describes each post type. What are notes used for? Why can't I post a multiple-choice as an excercise? These type of questions will be answered in the pop-up module.

#### Votes / Views

Votes seem like a metric worth keeping. Views, however, do not. A problem may receive a lot of views, but what does that mean really? If the problem was good, it will receive votes. The wireframe shows three stars to the left of each problem. These stars indicate activity (views) but the user will read it as popular or not popular where as the language of "views" is confusing.

#### Related Books

Two thoughts came to mind - 1) Having 3 columns really divides up the users attention, 2) These books, while important, were taking up too much real estate. Placing them in the right sidebar puts them in clear view. Making the container expandable by the user helps keep things tidy.

#### Review / Ask Questions / Provide Feedback

I want your input. Take your time to review these 3 screens and write your notes. If something is missing that you feel needs to be included, let me know. Chances are I felt it was not crucial to the goals of the website so I intentionally removed it.

#### Wireframes

Please note the "Jump To" drop-down menu. In the menu you'll find 3 different pages (Home, Question, and Profile).

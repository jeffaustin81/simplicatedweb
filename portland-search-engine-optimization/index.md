You're looking for some help getting visitors to your website? I appreciate you clicking on whichever link that brought you here, but I no longer offer Search Engine Optimization services.

#### What? No SEO!
Yup. Believe it or not I'm going to stick to what I'm good at - good 'ol fashion design.

#### Who Can Help My Website Rank for Keywords X,Y, & Z?
Well, if you truly enjoy and believe in what you do, then you are the right person for the job. You see, there's no trick with climbing the ranks of Google or other search engines. It takes a lot of hard work to produce great content day-in and day-out. If you love what you do, you know what your customers want. Roll up your sleeves and write, make videos or create infographics around your industry.

#### But I Want Traffic Without a Lot of Extra Work!
Sorry. Gone are the days of listing your website on every online directory or playing the link exchange game. Every link you get must be earned. Don't bother plastering message boards, forums, or blog comments with links either. In fact, that will do more harm than good.

#### What Should I Do?
Be a content producing machine. Don't be afraid to give information away that will gain new followers. You're the expert in what you do and now it's time you let your customers, fans and the world know it. Answer questions on Twitter and take part in the growing online community.

#### But That Takes Time!
All good things do. You can do it. I know you can.

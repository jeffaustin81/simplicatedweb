Whether you are just starting your business and need a website to support your launch, or are looking for a fresh, new look to your current website, I will help you get there.

<h4>WordPress Website Design</h4>
<p>Content Management Systems (CMSs) are all the rage. WordPress is my go-to CMS as it's widely used, continuously maintained and supported, and provides a low barrier to entry for clients.</p>
<p>A custom WordPress Website can cost between $2,000 and $7,000.</p>

<h4>Web App Design</h4>
<p>I can help you with initial planning, wireframing and producing great visuals for your web app. I'll write the HTML, CSS and JavaScript and will work with you or your team to implement it on top of your backend.</p>

<h4>Website Design</h4>
<p>Static websites have some great advantages.</p>
<ol>
	<li>No database to backup.</li>
	<li>Less likely to be hacked.</li>
	<li>You aren't restricted by a CMSs functionality (everything is just as you want)</li>
</ol>

<p>Hand coded in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, your website will stand the test of time.</p>

<h4>Website Design Visuals</h4>
<p>Already have a developer on-board that can turn a PSD into a website? Great. I can provide you and your team with a Photoshop-only website.</p>

<p>Design-only jobs cost between $1,000 and $4,000.</p>

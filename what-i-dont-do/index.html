<h4 class="sub-title">Development-only</h4>
<p>
It's important to note that I'm a web designer first and a web developer second. While I'm very capable and well-practiced in custom web development, I do not offer it as a stand-alone service. I will develop only when it supports my design work.
</p>

<h4 class="sub-title">Hosting and domain names</h4>
<p>
You should always be in control of your own domain name and hosting. I will provide you with recommendations when needed.
</p>

<h4 class="sub-title">Anything to do with email<span class="footnote">*</span></h4>
<p>
There are too many issues that could go wrong with email and I'm not an expert. I don't recommend your email server be the same as your web server. Contact your IT professional for more information.
</p>
<p><span class="footnote">*</span> Except when a contact form is involved.</p>

<h4 class="sub-title">Website Maintenance</h4>
<p>
I create most sites with <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> which has an easy-to-use update system. Regularly check your dashboard each month for new updates.
</p>

<h4 class="sub-title">Search Engine Optimization</h4>
<p>
I've been working on the web for a long time and had, at one time, offered SEO services. <a href="/portland-search-engine-optimization/">I don't do so anymore.</a> You should hire someone who specializes in this in addition to a content strategist.
